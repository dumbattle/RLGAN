- Discriminator Training
    a) Use generated images directly from agent
    b) use some from buffer
    c) ratio - 2 : 1 : 1 :: real : from generator : from buffer

- Save model to continue training in different session

- Mask agent action
    a) flat rate (ie. 0.8)
    b) range (ie [0, 0.8])

    Less actions hopefully will allow for better training
